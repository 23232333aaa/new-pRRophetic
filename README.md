# new-pRRophetic
A newly changed version of R package pRRophetic.
This content is copied from WeChat official account [果子学生信]( https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/SwnmKCjzURNV4B848nCvsw "果子学生信文章").
The original R package is too old to be used in the R 4.x series (error: `the condition has length > 1` results in no PDF output), so use this new R package.
In addition, the author of the original R package modified the R package on 2023.12.12 to solve this problem, but it was not packaged, so you need to manually modify the original R package and repackage it. For details, see the author's [github]( https://github.com/paulgeeleher/pRRophetic/commit/e7edea1c0d3ee2aa466d6f6571cf72aff24a5cc0 "author’s changes"), which is consistent with the modification method of the WeChat public account.
